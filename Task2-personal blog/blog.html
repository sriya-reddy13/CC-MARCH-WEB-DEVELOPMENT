             <p>Coorg or traditionally known as Kodagu is a sleepy hilly hamlet tucked on the Western Ghats. Surrounded by misty valleys, rolling hills, lush plantations, and pristine waterfalls, it’s a treat for all senses and a thing of beauty that no traveller ever forgets. It is one of the most prosperous hill towns of Karnataka .Experience the best homestays. The district is home to beautiful colonial cottages and bungalows, and some of those cottages have been turned into homestays. You can book a stay at any of these homestays and have a taste of the local lifestyle, home-cooked, traditional food, and learn about the people. You can also try a homestay within a coffee plantation. 
                Try the Madikeri Trek. It is the most popular activity to do in here and covers all major nature spots. The trek begins in Madikeri town and takes you to the Raja’s Seat, followed by the Madikeri Fort, and the Abbey Falls. The route passes through spice plantations, coffee estates, paddy fields, small rivulets, and offers incredible views of the hills and valleys.Try river rafting. The Cauvery River offers a great platform for river rafting. You can camp by the riverside and then enjoy a day of rafting. The best time to do this is during or right after the monsoon when the water level on the river and streams is higher.  </p>

              <p>To Visit Hampi in Karnataka was in my travel bucket list for a long time  and finally visited Hampi in October 2018.  Hampi was blissful. Here is my travel blog on things to do in Hampi.
                Hampi has an unearthly landscape of boulders, fascinating history in each corner, thousands of years old ruined temples and palaces , unbelievable architecture (lotus mahal, queen's bath), green paddy fields and mischievous monkeys! It’s truly a land of fantasy. Hampi let travelers dive into history to experience the lost tales of South India’s largest, wealthiest and the most powerful kingdom, Vijayanagara Empire.</p>
                Hampi is split into two sides, one is the ruin/ heritage side and other is the hippie side of Hampi (across the Tungabhadra river). The hippie side is gaining popularity between the young crowd due to its laid back and super relaxing vibes.

             <p>It was in the month of August when I decided to chase the rain in the second wettest terrains on the planet. What better time to dance in the rain than monsoon in Cherrapunji in Meghalaya, the land of clouds. Charrapunji is credited as being the second wettest place on earth. Originally known as “Sohra”, the British pronounced it “Churra” before it got its popular name as Cherrapunji. Situated on the southern edge of the Khasi Hills, this town shares its international border with Bangladesh on its south.
                Nearly 60 km away from Shillong, Cherrapunji offers one of the most picturesque landscapes and unparalleled scenic beauty. The surroundings are mostly dotted with towering Khasi hills and valleys beyond your horizon. You are welcomed by the charming Khasi people with a big smile. Known as “the abode of clouds”, Meghalaya surprises you with its splendid secrets.
                While driving up , I saw the very first layers of clouds in the Khasi hills in Upper Shillong. It was a sight well framed in my mind. I stood still for a few minutes to have a glimpse of this amazing view. As I was approaching the Sohra valley, I rolled down my windows,popping my head out to let the swirls of clouds play with my hair.here are some interesting living root bridges around the villages near Cherrapunji, like the Umshiang root bridge, Mawsaw root bridge, Ritymmen root bridge, and the Double Decker woot bridge at Nongriat village, each of which is a unique thing to see and experience. 
                Live in the “cleanest village of Asia” in Mawlynnong which is picture-perfect with endless greenery, sparkling lakes, and fresh, unpolluted air.</p>

              <p>A  passionate Traveller</p>
            </div>
            <p> “Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times”My passion is learning about life through travelling and exploring new things. It excites me when I visit new places, learn about different cultures, and see other people live a life that is different from mine. I just love to travel because it makes me realize that the world is so beautiful and there is so much to admire and treasure.“I love to travel because it takes me out of my comfort zone and I am always learning something new about myself and about that place each day I'm there.For me it's meeting new people and learning about their different way of life - culture, traditions, food. And seeing what makes each place so unique! Love finding a spot with a view that I'll always remember about that specific trip."
